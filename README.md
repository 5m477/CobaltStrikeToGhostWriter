# CobaltStrikeToGhostWriter
Log converter from CS logs to a CSV in [Ghostwriter's](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter) operation log format. Will spit out the CSV in the same directory where the script is being run. I know it's not perfect and probably shit code, feel free to make a pull request.



**Usage:** python CS2GW.py C:\Path\To\Log\Folder

**Output File:** CS2GW.csv

To do: Fix SMB Beacon names
